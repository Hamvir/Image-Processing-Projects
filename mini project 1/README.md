# Some Basic Image Processing Functions Implementation
The following things have been implemented:

## PART 1 (Contrast Enhancement)
### (a) Applying FSCS and SCS
The task is to apply 2 contrast enhancement techniques :
1) Full Scale Contrast Enhancement(FSCS)
2) Saturated Contrast Stretching(SCS)
and plot their histograms to see the effect of contrast stretch.
### (b) Histogram equalization
The task is to do histogram equalisation from scratch without using any libraries.
## PART 2 (Image downsampling and interpolation)
The task is to first downsample the image by a factor of 3 then upsample it to original size by following two methods:
1) Nearest Neighbour interpolation
2) Bilinear Interpolation
## PART 3 (Spatial Domain Filtering)
The task is to do image sharpening(sharpen the blurred image) by using high boost filtering.
## How to use:
>Download the ipynb file.

>open it any jupyter notebook

>Run line by line to see how the code works

>You can give any image of your choice(grey scale) by just replacing the image names at appropriate positions

All example images have been included in image file
